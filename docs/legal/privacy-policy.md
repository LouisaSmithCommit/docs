## About us & this privacy policy

We’re Commit. Our key operating principle is “do what’s best for the engineer” and that extends to how we handle your information. 
- We are incorporated as Commit Solutions Inc. in British Columbia, Canada.

This is our Privacy Policy and it applies to how & when we collect, use, store, and share your information on our websites and apps where we offer and provide our products. 
- Our website is https://commit.dev and we have other websites and apps on our domains, which include commit.dev and getzero.dev. 

We have tried to write this Privacy Policy in plain language to make it easy to understand and less painful to read. 
- We’re aiming for “approachable”, but this could also come across as “casual” and we don’t want you to think that we take a casual approach to handling your information.
- We take the privacy and security of your information very seriously and, if we say in this Privacy Policy that we’ll never do something, then we’re never going to do it (and vice versa).

We have also tried to be blunt about where we’re at as a startup. We’re not going to promise to be perfect, but we can promise to be thoughtful, transparent, and accountable. 
- If you need to know more about who we are or what we’re doing or why we need certain information, take a look first at [Commit Docs](https://docs.commit.dev). 
- If what you’re looking for isn’t there, you can ask us through GitHub or by [contacting us](#how-can-you-contact-us).

If you decide not to share your information with us, you won’t be able to use our products and will want to steer clear of digitally visiting and interacting with us. That’s too bad, but also okay - we know that we’re not for everyone. 

## What information do we collect about you? Do we collect your personal information?

We collect:
- information about you as an individual, e.g., your email address and hobbies; and
- information about you as a user, e.g., your setting preferences, usage metrics, and IP address.

Some of that information may directly identify you (e.g., your email address) or may be reasonably linked or combined with other information (e.g., your IP address) to identify you and would be considered “personal information”. 
- We usually take a consistent approach to all of your information, so your personal information and non-personal information would be treated to an equally high standard. 
- There are certain instances where we apply an even higher standard for your personal information, e.g., if you’re one of our employees and we have to ask for and store your Social Insurance Number.

Depending on where you live (or where you are a citizen), there may be applicable legislation that defines “personal information” or “personal data” differently and/or more specifically. That legislation may also outline specific legal rights that you have with respect to that information. 
- If that’s you and you would like to exercise one of those rights, [contact us](#how-can-you-contact-us).

## How & when do we collect your information?

We collect your information:
- when you give it to us directly, including in-product or in a job application;
- when you interact with us, including on social media platforms and via email;
- automatically through our websites and apps; and
- from other people/service providers, including through integrations with other service providers.

We use cookies and third-party web analytics for automatic collection of information about you, including:
- Google Analytics; and 
- other metrics tools from time to time, on an experimental basis.

## How do we use your information?

We use your information when we provide our products to you. 
- One example of this is we may use your name to greet you when you log on to our platform. 
- Another example is we may use your device information or IP address to optimize how things are displayed to you. 

We use your information together with other users’ information to make decisions when developing and improving our products. We are still experimenting and iterating. Tracking how you use our products helps us immensely in confirming what works and what to build next.

We use your information to contact you. If you would like us to stop contacting you, you can use the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our emails to let us know (or [contact us](#how-can-you-contact-us)).

## When do we share your information outside of Commit?

We share your information with others when we provide our products to you – we only share what is required to do the thing that needs to be done. What is shared and who it’s shared with should not be surprising to you. A couple examples:
- If you are in our Engineering Partner program, we will share certain information about you (such as your name and preferred tech stack) with startup partners when we are trying to match you for a pilot. 
- If you set up an account on our platform and fill out your user profile, other users on our platform will be able to see what you put into your user profile. (Your account settings would be private to you.)

We also share your information with other service providers that we use to provide our products and do business. Here’s a table of the big ones: 

|Service provider|Example of use|Link to their security creds|
|--|--|--|
|AWS|hosting| https://aws.amazon.com/security/ |
|Google Workspace|internal business things, like email and document storage|https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_ca/security/|
|Humi|human resources|https://www.humi.ca/security|
|Airtable|internal database|https://www.airtable.com/security\
|Hubspot|CRM, marketing, operations|https://legal.hubspot.com/security|
|HelloSign|sending documents for signatures|https://www.hellosign.com/trust/security|
|Slack|communication|https://slack.com/security-practices|
|Asana|internal project and task management|https://asana.com/security-standards|
|Together|mentoring|https://help.togetherplatform.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401992420251-Security-Overview|


We will also share your information with others:
- when you specifically tell us to or you give us permission to share your information;
- when the law says we have to; or
- if something fundamental changes for Commit as an organization, such as getting acquired.

We never sell your information.

## How do we store and protect your information?

We implement physical, business, and technical security measures to protect your personal information. 
- One example is that we use 1Password and 2FA when we can for logging into our accounts with other service providers. 
- It’s kind of funny to mention “physical measures” when Commit is a remote-first organization, but we still have to use physical computers and sometimes our people work from non-private locations like a coworking space, so we still have to make sure that people know to not leave their laptop lying around and to lock the screen whenever they step away. 

We don’t want to keep your information for any longer than we need it - we should be keeping it only long enough to do what we collected it for. Right now this looks like periodic clean-ups and clean-outs of information and databases by our teams. 

## What happens when we need to update this Privacy Policy?

When we need to update this Privacy Policy, we’ll post the updated policy here with a new effective date at the top of the page. We may also announce the update through other channels, such as our website or platform. 
- If you keep using our products or providing information to us after the effective date of an updated policy, then we're going to assume that you’re cool with the updates. 
- If you’re not actually okay with what we’ve changed, you should stop using our products. You can also ask us to delete your information by [contacting us](#how-can-you-contact-us).

## How can you contact us?

It’s a bit old school, but just go with it and email us at [privacy@commit.dev](mailto:privacy@commit.dev).
