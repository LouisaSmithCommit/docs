# Testimonials

Dozens of our developers in the Commit community have benefited from Sphere Coaching. Here’s what they’re saying:

*“I thought it would be a good opportunity to develop more consistency, set some goals for the future, and be a little less stressed about things. Also: to develop myself more as a leader, to become better at talking to customers and grow in other areas related to business—not just software engineering.”* - [Thiago A.](https://blog.commit.dev/articles/personal-coaching-at-commit-part-iv-engineering-partner-thiago-araujo)

*“I’ve found it extremely helpful to have somebody to talk to who is focused on my performance. Someone who has an outsider’s perspective, who isn't already connected to me. I found that liberating and quite meaningful.”* - [King C.](https://blog.commit.dev/articles/personal-coaching-at-commit-part-ii-a-conversation-with-engineering-partner-king-choi)
