Here are some critical things for you to know as a Commit Startup Partner (SP):

### Our Commitment to the Program

### Communication, Participation and Collaboration are Key

-   Career Long Relationship - As a hiring manager, our partnership is with you. Even if you change jobs, we are dedicated to supporting your journey as a startup leader and executive.

### Expectations During Onboarding

-   Distributed by Design - Commit is a remote-first organization. As such, our startups must be remote or hybrid only. For our hybrid startups, we expect Commit’s remote developers to be core contributors to the team.
    
-   Salary Bands - Our developers are pegged against the best of the best tech talent. As such, we expect our SPs to adhere to the average industry salary bands.
    
-   Ability to Hire - Currently we are hiring developers based in Canada. However, as a remote-first organization we will become more location-agnostic in the future. Please let us know if you are unable to hire from countries outside of your organization's geographic location from the get-go.
    

### Expectations During Interviews

-   No technical Interviews - We encourage you to check out the candidates’ Record of Work (RoW). With the information available from candidates' profiles on the Commit app along with the [pre-vetting process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpUrPyYLrRB3bmWwPNZcDrdkAH7sVGBCHpAbXnCo-qY/edit?usp=sharing) by the Commit technical community, you'll be able to skip technical rounds and instead focus on value alignment and company fit.
    
-   Rapid Feedback - After every interview, we ask for a brief retrospective (stop/start/continue) to ensure we can give feedback to the developers to help them continue to grow.
