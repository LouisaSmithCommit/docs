### How to Interview a Commit developer

As previously mentioned, our own technical assessors conduct a thorough technical assessment. You’ll be able to see the results and a full overview of their technical abilities prior to your interview with them. 

Therefore, instead of talking to them about coding projects, you’ll be able to spend your time getting to know the Commit developer on a more personal level and asking more questions to ensure they are a good culture/team fit.

You can learn more about Commit's interview process [in this article.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpUrPyYLrRB3bmWwPNZcDrdkAH7sVGBCHpAbXnCo-qY/edit?usp=sharing)
  
We strongly recommend you read our [interview guide](https://www.notion.so/Commit-s-Guide-to-Interviewing-Commit-Engineers-8d8e9f4441e74137b082d0b140bcb454) to make the most out of your conversation.
