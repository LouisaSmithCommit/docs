This article provides an overview of what a Startup Partner can expect in the onboarding and matchmaking process.

## Step 1: Review Relevant Paperwork
-   You'll receive paperwork for the relevant program(s) of interest from [Megha](https://docs.commit.dev/sps/about#engage-with-the-team-answering-your-questions). Depending on the program, signatures may be required before we can send you candidates. If any questions arise, you can respond via email and [Tiff](https://docs.commit.dev/sps/about#engage-with-the-team-answering-your-questions) will respond within 48 hours. Once all is set, you will join Commit as a Startup Partner (SP).
    
## Step 2: Join Commit on Slack

-   We will send an invite to your company’s hiring manager to join us on Slack. This will help us streamline our communications with you and provide any answers or additional information quickly. Feel free to invite other team members who you feel may benefit from being added to this private channel.
  
## Step 3: Complete Company Profile

-   We will send you a draft version of your profile for approval, including the roles you wish to post with us. The information here is gathered from our prior calls with you.
    
- If you are a returning SP, you do not have to complete a new profile. Instead, we will send you your previously completed profile for you to edit, which should take approximately 5-10 minutes.


## Step 4: Reviewing Candidate Profiles

-   Once the profile and roles are visible on the platform, we can send you candidates. The Engineer Success team aims to send 3 qualified candidates within 48 hours. You will also receive an email notifying you of potential candidate matches and within the email, you can review the candidate’s full profile. For increased visibility, you will receive a copy of this email to your dedicated Slack channel as well.
    

### Option 1: Startup Partner Declines

-   If we send you a candidate and you feel they don’t meet your needs, you can reject the candidate in the platform. Upon submission, you will be prompted to provide feedback about why you declined the candidate. This helps us send you more aligned matches in the future.
    
### Option 2: Startup Partner Accepts

-   If we send you a candidate and you feel they do meet your needs, you can accept the candidate in the platform.
    

## Step 5: Candidate Decides on Next Steps

-   Once you accept a candidate, your Startup Partner (SP) profile will be sent to the candidate for them to decide if this is an opportunity they wish to pursue.

### Option 1: Candidate Declines

-   If the candidate declines, you will receive an email and Slack message notifying you the candidate has rejected the opportunity along with their reason for this decision.
    
### Option 2: Candidate Accepts

-   If the candidate accepts, an email will be sent to you and the candidate so you can connect. The candidate will reply to the email with their booking link so you can easily find time in their calendars to meet with them.
    

## Step 6: Interviews Occur

  
-   To help you conduct and prepare for the interviews with our candidates, we have a best practice document you can review and use as your guide.
    

## Step 7: Provide Feedback & Decide on Next Steps

  

-   After the interview, we will ask you to provide feedback about the candidate and if you would like to pursue the next steps with offering a pilot, or organizing an additional interview round.
    

### Option 1: Decline Candidate

-   If you decline the candidate, we encourage you to share any feedback for improvement directly with the candidate. You can also share feedback with us so we can send you more aligned matches in the future.
    
### Option 2: Proceed with an Additional Interview

-   We try to encourage our SPs to have as few interviews as possible but we recognize sometimes other team members need to be involved in the decision making process. To book more time with the candidate, you can use the original booking link from the initial email.
    
### Option 3: Proceed with Offering a Pilot

-   If you would like to move forward with offering a pilot, the Engineer Success team will work with you and the candidate to determine a start date. From there, the scope of work will be sent.
