## Commit’s Interview Process

The purpose of this documentation is to help you gain a better understanding of how we both interview and match our Engineering Partners (EPs) with our Startup Partners (SPs). Read about our process in more detail below.

### Step 1: Meeting our Engineer Concierge

This is a 30-minute conversation where we assess the developer against essential skills - dedication, accountability, self-starter, growth mindset, humility/empathy, collaboration, communication skills and self-awareness. We believe each of these skills are critical to succeed at a startup.

### Step 2: The Tech Assessment

Developers who pass the first step of the screening process are then invited for a 60- to 90-minute tech assessment and are asked to provide the names, emails and titles of three references (individuals they’ve worked closely with in their past few roles) to get an additional perspective of the candidate and their potential.

This technical conversation is led by a member of our staff engineering team who has more experience than the candidate to ensure effective evaluation of the candidate’s technical abilities. This conversation is premised on systems design and inquiry-based questions to learn about projects they’ve worked on, challenges and tradeoffs they encountered, tools and tactics they used, and what they would do differently in hindsight.

*At Commit, we believe the best way to gauge an developer’s level of understanding about a language or framework is having them explain it. The bonus factor is that this approach helps nervous or introverted candidates to open up by talking proudly about the codes they’ve written, projects they’ve contributed to, and problems they’ve solved.*

### Step 3: Meeting our CTO

Developers who pass the technical assessment are invited to the final step which is to meet our CTO for a 30-minute conversation where we assess their fit for the role and startup work culture. This also gives developers the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about joining Commit and working with our startup partners.

## Hackathon Onboarding Project

If a developer is extended an offer to join the Engineering Partner Program and they choose to accept it, they will spend the first week of their start date onboarding with Commit. During the second day of this onboarding week, the developers will start working on their Hackathon Onboarding Project (HOP) and will have to present it on the seventh day. For this project, they will identify an engineering challenge, come up with a potential solution, produce a working product, and present the problem and their approach to a panel of Commit interviewers and community members.

The benefit of this Hackathon Onboarding Project is that Commit developers get an opportunity to further practice their presentation and communication skills in a safe, supportive environment.

## Why Commit Doesn’t Conduct Traditional Tech Interviews

At Commit, we believe that traditional technical interviews fail to capture and assess a developer's full potential. Our technical assessment is an open-ended, transparent conversation to have developers elaborately describe their experiences. This conversational approach creates a stress-free, comfortable environment for the developer and requires no prep or post-work, enabling a positive candidate experience.

In traditional technical interviews, developers are generally expected to complete coding and whiteboard exercises before, during or after an interview - not to mention that all this work to demonstrate skill proficiency may not be required for the day-to-day work of the specified role. The lack of clarity about what skills a particular position may or may not require is what leads to multiple rounds of technical assessments, making it a frustrating experience for developers. That’s why at Commit, we tailor opportunities to our developers, allowing us to focus on the developer’s top strengths. This lets the developer showcase their best skills instead of checking boxes on a predetermined list of technical skills.

The outcome of this conversation provides us with a lot of information about the developer’s thought process, depth of knowledge and understanding, ability to solve problems, and seniority level with the tools and systems they describe to us. It may not provide us with enough insight into how they write code. However, in our assessors’ experience, if a developer can effectively communicate the technicalities of their work at the level we expect, they are likely very capable of writing code at the level we require.

As an organization built for developers by developers, we know the frustrations and partialities developers face in the name of technical interviews. With this in mind, our interview process is structured to make career transitions hassle-free for developers and to highlight that technical vetting is possible without a series of intensive technical assessments. This experience is what brings top-notch developers to our network, so we ask that our startup partners also prioritize this and not include a technical component in their interviews as we will be vetting developers in our own way, ensuring a positive experience for both the candidate as well as the startup partner.

Collectively, our staff engineering team has several years of startup and software development experience. We are more than confident in their ability to assess the candidates' soft and hard skills. Feel free to check out our Engineering Partner Selection Team below.

## Startup Partner Matchmaking

### Step 1: Review Relevant Paperwork

  
-   You'll receive paperwork for the relevant program(s) of interest from [Megha](https://docs.commit.dev/sps/about#engage-with-the-team-answering-your-questions). Depending on the program, signatures may be required before we can send you candidates. If any questions arise, you can respond via email and [Tiff](https://docs.commit.dev/sps/about#engage-with-the-team-answering-your-questions) will respond within 48 hours. Once all is set, you will join Commit as a Startup Partner (SP).
    

### Step 2: Join Commit on Slack

-   We will send an invite to your company’s hiring manager to join us on Slack. This will help us streamline our communications with you and provide any answers or additional information quickly. Feel free to invite other team members who you feel may benefit from being added to this private channel.
    

### Step 3: Complete Company Profile

-   We will send you a draft version of your profile for approval, including the roles you wish to post with us. The information here is gathered from our prior calls with you.
    
-   Note: If you are a returning SP, you do not have to complete a new profile. Instead, we will send you your previously completed profile for you to edit, which should take approximately 5-10 minutes.
    

### Step 4: Reviewing Candidate Profiles

-   Once the profile and roles are visible on the platform, we can send you candidates. The Engineer Success team aims to send 3 qualified candidates within 48 hours. You will also receive an email notifying you of potential candidate matches and within the email, you can review the candidate’s full profile. For increased visibility, you will receive a copy of this email to your dedicated Slack channel as well.
    

#### Option 1: Startup Partner Declines

-   If we send you a candidate and you feel they don’t meet your needs, you can reject the candidate in the platform. Upon submission, you will be prompted to provide feedback about why you declined the candidate. This helps us send you more aligned matches in the future.
    
#### Option 2: Startup Partner Accepts

-   If we send you a candidate and you feel they do meet your needs, you can accept the candidate in the platform.
    

### Step 5: Candidate Decides on Next Steps

-   Once you accept a candidate, your Startup Partner (SP) profile will be sent to the candidate for them to decide if this is an opportunity they wish to pursue.

#### Option 1: Candidate Declines

-   If the candidate declines, you will receive an email and Slack message notifying you the candidate has rejected the opportunity along with their reason for this decision.
    
#### Option 2: Candidate Accepts

-   If the candidate accepts, an email will be sent to you and the candidate so you can connect. The candidate will reply to the email with their booking link so you can easily find time in their calendars to meet with them.
    

### Step 6: Interviews Occur

  
-   To help you conduct and prepare for the interviews with our candidates, we have best practices outlined below in our Guide to Interviewing Commit Developers.
    

### Step 7: Provide Feedback & Decide on Next Steps

-   After the interview, we will ask you to provide feedback about the candidate and if you would like to pursue the next steps with offering a pilot, or organizing an additional interview round.
    

#### Option 1: Decline Candidate

-   If you decline the candidate, we encourage you to share any feedback for improvement directly with the candidate. You can also share feedback with us so we can send you more aligned matches in the future.
    
#### Option 2: Proceed with an Additional Interview

-   We try to encourage our SPs to have as few interviews as possible but we recognize sometimes other team members need to be involved in the decision making process. To book more time with the candidate, you can use the original booking link from the initial email.
    
#### Option 3: Proceed with Offering a Pilot

-   If you would like to move forward with offering a pilot, the Engineer Success team will work with you and the candidate to determine a start date. From there, the scope of work will be sent.
    

## Guide to Interviewing Commit Developers

When interviewing our Engineering Partners (EPs), the focus is to get to know the developer’s experiences and skills, and ensure they’re a good fit for your team. Our EPs do not expect a technical component in their interview with you and are not doing technical interviews at other startups we match them with.

To help you understand how your interactions with our developers work, this document covers:

1.  The anonymized brief: what you'll know about an developer when there's a match
    
2.  How to prepare for an interview with Commit developers
    
3.  Communication with Commit developers during the process
    
4.  Why Commit doesn't recommend startups to conduct technical interviews
    
5.  Commit’s success rate
    

#### 1. What info you'll get on an developer before the interview

Commit matches you with developers based on your role, company values, tech stack, industry, and seniority. When there is a match, you will receive an anonymized brief speaking to a developer's experiences and background, as well as the reason why we recommended the match. You can review all the profiles, and request an interview with the preferred developer via the link we provide.

Note: We share anonymous briefs to be inclusive and help minimize the potential for negative bias. These briefs don't include demographic data, or names (which can suggest demographic data).

If there is mutual interest in an interview, the developer will reach out to schedule a time to meet.

A resume for the developer is available upon request. We can also provide a technical interview summary, which captures our assessment of a developer's essential skills, technical abilities, career goals and interests.

#### 2. How to structure interviews with Commit developers

An introduction will be made via e-mail between you and the candidate for a 60-minute virtual interview.

For this conversation, we recommend no more than four individuals attend from your startup; the smaller the number, the more intimate the conversation. We recommend you include: the engineering manager (typically the CTO or VP Eng), up to two peers that this individual would be working with, and potentially the startup co-founder, depending on the company stage and how closely this developer will work with them.

The focus is to understand the developer's skill set and experience, share details on your business and the specific project they would be working on, and ensure a good cultural alignment.

Our EPs do not expect a technical component in their interview with you and are not actively going through technical interviews at other organizations.

#### 3. What to share with an developer before an interview

Interviewing is likely a well-oiled process for you. You run the same playbook for every hire, everyone on your team knows their roles, and you've fleshed out the questions you want to ask and benchmarked answers you're looking for.

Interviewing is not quite so standardized for your candidates! Every company they meet with has different people on the call, probing different questions, with a different mix of behavioural, situational, and knowledge questions.

The best way for you to ensure you're assessing a candidate's intellect, conscientiousness, and creativity is by making sure you're giving them the right information to come prepared.

These best practices are constantly evolving - if your startup does something unique that you think Commit should learn from, reach out to the Engineer success team on your dedicated Slack channel and they can add it to this guide!

**Pre-Interview Communication Best Practices**

-   Once you've coordinated the interview, make sure you send a calendar invitation that includes the names of all attendees and video conferencing details.
    
-   Send a summary email that outlines who will be on the call (name, role, how they would interact with you if hired) as well as the overall structure of the interview (i.e., behavioural, cultural, etc.) Include any software that they need installed and/or open during the conversation in your summary email.    

#### 4. Why Commit has recommendations for your interviews with a candidate

Top developers join Commit because of the streamlined interview process they have with startups. Our recommendations are in service of creating a positive experience for highly skilled developers.

The best developers can find a job easily once they want one. The process of a single initial technical interview (in the form of Commit's own interview), skipping all additional tech screens, and going directly to final conversations with company and team leadership features heavily in our ability to attract these top candidates. We need your help in guaranteeing that experience so we can continue introducing you to top developers.

If you have any concerns or doubts at the end of your interview with a developer that you think could be answered with more information, reach out to the Engineer Success team on your dedicated Slack channel, and we can work with you to fill in the missing pieces. If you feel strongly about conducting your own technical interview after your initial conversation, we will put your request to the developer, and will support their decision to either continue with you or focus on the other Commit-style interviews they have lined up.

#### 5. Commit's success rate

-   We hire approximately 1 out of every 200 or 0.5% of candidates.
    
-   <2% of all developers hired at Commit have left a pilot early due to their technical skills (just 2 people!)
