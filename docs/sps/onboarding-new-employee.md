# Commit's Guide to Onboarding New Employees

We're always learning onboarding best practices from our startup partners. These best practices are constantly evolving - if your startup does something unique that you think Commit should learn from, reach out to the Engineer Success Team so they can add it to this guide!

**Onboarding Best Practices**

-   ✉️ Once you've finalized paperwork, send a welcome email to your new hire at their personal email! You might want to cc their new peers and/or team leads so they get a sense of who they'll be working with, and so the team can chime in with their excitement.
-   📆 Set them up with a company email address and make sure they're added to meeting invites, slack channels, group emails, etc.
-   💿 Highlight any software and workplace setups they need to install before the first day. Each dev team should have a standardized way to set up their local development environment and workflow procedures. Share access to any repository documentation as well! This should include a wiki detailing how to use the codebase, how it’s been designed, manifestos on core principles, and any other content relevant to the project.
-   🗄️ Send over any documents and permissions to tools they might need to hit the ground running on their first day (e.g. company wiki, recordings/agenda of prior all hands, any documents that lay out your thinking around the mission/product/values). 
-   👋 Send a welcome message in your company Slack so the full team can say hi.
-   ✅ Share an onboarding checklist that walks them through all the tasks they need to accomplish in the first week. It gives them a sense of accomplishment in the first day or two when they might not be writing code yet, and helps managers get visibility on roadblocks they might be running into. We also find it helpful to schedule some activities for their first day (e.g. coffee with their immediate team, a start of day and end of day touchpoint with their manager).
-   📓 Link to their [manager's Readme](https://managerreadme.com/readme/orenellenbogen)
-   🐕 Create space for their life. Ask them if there are particular times that are no-gos for meetings (ie. they have to bring kids to school or make sure their dog gets outside).
-   🕵🏽 Connect them with an onboarding buddy who can be their guide for questions, whether trivial and existential.
-   📝 Agree on the cadence that you two will meet 1:1 for bi-directional feedback.
-   📽 Walk them through your product backlog and upcoming priorities, as well as the future state of the product that you're driving towards.

**Best Practices for Your First Technical Hire**

-   📽 Present your pitch deck to share your vision and [the world that exists around your company.](https://alexdanco.com/2021/04/10/world-building/)
