## Overview

As part of your first few weeks at Commit, we want to provide something that will let EPs get excited about coding and start to contribute to the Commit community.

### What's the benefit of a HOP?
- We believe this will help you get to know the team, practice some coding skills and help us build a better experience for everyone at Commit. 
- You may not have had the time, resources, or supportive community to start a project you're interested in. Your HOP gives you the space to do that!
- You will demo your HOP the Thursday after after your start date. This is a great opportunity for you to get feedback from your peers in a supportive environment, and test the waters with presenting a technical idea in a safe space.

If you have any questions, get in touch with us in your EPX Slack Channel. Your Onboarding Partner (OP) has also completed a HOP so they are a great person to ask any questions!

## Timeline and Expectations

You begin your HOP on Day 2 (Thursday) of your onboarding and present your HOP on Day 7 (Thursday).


Your demo will be no more than 10 minutes and should provide details about:

- Why this project in particular (out of the endless options in the world!)
- Why you chose the tech stack you did to complete the project
- Stretch goals/next steps
- A demo of the project - we want to see how it works :) 
We really look forward to your demo! 

*Note: This is a learning exercise, not something that needs to be fully completed in the timeline. If you’ve worked on something, please demo it even if it’s not finished or polished! Sharing is caring.*
