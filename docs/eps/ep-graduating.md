Commit calls the process of you moving to a Startup Partner (SP) full-time “graduating”. It’s part of the process and we are excited when people get to do it!

If you need a refresher on this process, check out our [EP Program Overview](/eps/ep-overview). 
 
The Engineer Success team will reach out to both you and the SP 1 month before your 3-month pilot end date to determine if you both would like to move forward with graduating.

Commit will help with the paperwork vis a vis the graduate leaving Commit. Usually the SP has their own employment agreement (or independent contractor agreement) that they put together for the EP to join them.

If you have any questions about graduating with a SP, reach out to the Engineer Success team on your dedicated Slack channel and they will be able to help you. It’s possible to extend engagements with your SP for people who still have a lot to contribute to a SP but don’t see a long-term position there.
 
## I graduated! What's next?

You will still be a part of the Commit community, have access to our Slack groups, [our past and upcoming events](https://success.commit.dev/hc/en-us/categories/4425780934555-Events), and [mentorship opportunities](https://my.togetherplatform.com/signup?organizationId=eeJyrw40aXitpSZrR0Os), and be able to attend our monthly All Hands (and we hope you do!).

We want to support you as a member of the Commit community even when you have graduated, including helping you continue growing your career and skills. So we encourage you to stay involved, keep asking (or answering) questions, and getting advice from others in the community. We truly believe that collaboration is the key to success and this is a very open and inclusive community of senior software engineers!
