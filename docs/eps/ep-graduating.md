Commit calls the process of you moving to a Startup Partner (SP) full-time “graduating”. It’s part of the process and we are excited when people get to do it!

## Steps to Graduation
 
1. The Engineer Success team will reach out to both you and the SP 1 month before your 3-month pilot end date to determine if you both would like to move forward with graduating.

- If you'd both like to move forward, the Startup Partner will produce an offer for you to review.
- If one or both of you chooses not to move forward, you may be given the option to [return to matchmaking](https://docs.commit.dev/eps/ep-pilot#returning-to-commit-after-a-pilot) after your pilot ends. 

2. Usually the Startup Partner has their own employment agreement that they put together for you to join them. Commit is here to provide support in understanding the offer. 

- **Note**: We often suggest you inquire about extended health benefits, and request any applicable waiting period be waived as you've already been working with the Startup Partner for 3 months! The same suggestion applies to any probation period.

3. Once you're happy with the offer, sign that paperwork!

If you have any questions about graduating with a SP, reach out to the Engineer Success team on your dedicated Slack channel and they will be able to help you. 
 
## I graduated! What's next?

Here's what offboarding from Commit would look like:
1. You'd need to return your Commit laptop if we provided you one. Our Finance and Operations team will be in touch about this.
2. You'd receive your final payout on the 15th or last day of the month, depending on your official start date with your Startup Partner. 
3. You will still be a part of the Commit community, have access to our Slack groups, [our past and upcoming events](https://success.commit.dev/hc/en-us/categories/4425780934555-Events), and [mentorship opportunities](https://my.togetherplatform.com/signup?organizationId=eeJyrw40aXitpSZrR0Os), and be able to attend our bi-weekly HOP Demos and monthly All Hands (and we hope you do!).

We want to support you as a member of the Commit community even when you have graduated, including helping you continue growing your career and skills. So we encourage you to stay involved, keep asking (or answering) questions, and getting advice from others in the community. We truly believe that collaboration is the key to success and this is a very open and inclusive community of senior software engineers!
