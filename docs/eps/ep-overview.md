Commit is the remote-first developer community where senior software engineers get paid to find their next career opportunity, all while skipping the traditional tech interview.

What does that mean? We help you find your next job but we also provide you with additional tools and resources so your growth does not just start and stop when you have a new job. 

How we do this can be broken down into 4 phases:

## Phase 1: Interview with Commit

You complete a [3-part interview process](https://docs.commit.dev/eps/ep-applying#interview-process) with Commit over 7-10 days. You will discuss your motivations for joining Commit followed by a tech assessment and talk with our CEO to ask him any questions about us or working with the Startup Partners (SPs) in our community. 

## Phase 2: Join Commit

After receiving an offer from Commit, you become an Engineering Partner (EP). We consider you a partner as we always have your best interest in mind. You will join a community of senior software engineers and get paid to collaborate on open source projects, work with a career coach, and interview with our SPs. Our engineers typically interview with 3-4 startups to find a match. No whiteboard required! 

## Phase 3: Join a Startup for 3 months

Once you find a match with an SP, you spend three months working with them. If you are happy there, you graduate from Commit and join them full-time. If not, you come back to us and we will help you find another startup to work with that is better suited for your goals. Rinse and repeat until you feel comfortable and happy at an SP as your next career step!

## Phase 4: Grow your Career (indefinitely)

You join a startup but are still part of the Commit developer community for ongoing peer-to-peer support. We personalize your growth with world-class learning and development opportunities. You will need to join the community to really understand what that means.
