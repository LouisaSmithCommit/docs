Generally, most of our engineers use their own computers, however if you require a laptop, please email [accounting@commit.dev](mailto:accounting@commit.dev) and Commit can provide you with a Macbook! 

You can generally expect to receive the laptop around 2 weeks after your request. 

**Once you receive your laptop, please complete the following:**
- Keep all original packaging!! Yes, this includes the shipping box as well! When you graduate into a startup, you will have to mail the laptop back to Commit. 

**Before you ship the laptop back, please make sure you:**

- Disconnect the laptop from your Apple ID
- Factory reset the computer
- Wipe it down!
- Put it back into its original packaging
