:::info Congrats! You have accepted an SP’s interview request and have scheduled an interview. Here is a general overview of SP interviews, what you can expect, and some general tips on preparing for your interview. :::

## What you can expect

Generally, we encourage SPs to conduct one 1hr interview with Commit EPs. The focus is to get to know the engineer's skillset and experiences and ensure a good fit for the startup. We share that Commit EPs do not expect a technical component in their interviews and are not actively going through technical interviews at other organizations. You can see a complete summary of what we communicate with SPs [here](https://www.notion.so/A-Guide-to-Interviewing-Commit-Engineers-8d8e9f4441e74137b082d0b140bcb454).

### Times your interview process may deviate from the standard.

Some SPs may conduct more than one interview and/or ask you to complete a take-home coding assignment or do a technical interview. We understand this is not a standard process. When this arises, **it is up to the EP whether they would like to proceed or not**. The support team will support you in your decision as we understand that this deviates from the norm. However, please understand that choosing to push back on this may result in losing your candidacy.

Commit accepts SPs with these requirements because we feel that choice is a good thing. These SPs would not work with Commit if we did not deviate from our standard interview process. 

## Before the interview

### Familiarize yourself with the following materials:

**SP's website**

- Familiarize yourself with their product and who their customers are.
- Have you built or worked on a similar product? Do you understand their competitors and the competitive landscape of the SP? 
  - You will want to be able to speak to the above - prepare stories to share of your interactions with/experience with their product type, and their market
- Don’t have any related or relevant experience with their specific product? This is common!
  - You can speak to your specific interest with their product/market. Things to think about: Why do you find this an interesting industry? How will working in this industry/role help you achieve some of your professional goals? 
  
**SP profile on Helix**

- Who is going to be on the call? Do you know anyone in common? What do you know about them? 
- Take notes of anything you find on their profile that is interesting or relevant to your experience. 
 
**SP’s technical skills**

- Do you have experience in that tech stack? If so, what projects have you worked on related to that tech stack and what role did you play? What were the results?
- You will want to be prepared to share specific examples of how you have used/interacted with their tech stack.  
- If you have minimal experience with their tech stack, be prepared to share examples of how you have learned technical skills quickly, as they will be looking to gauge how quickly you can ramp up. 
 
**Your Helix profile and/or resume**

- Do you have any previous work experience that would relate to the roles and responsibilities of this SP position? These can be transferable skills such as prior product management experience, leadership skills, building an MVP, etc. 

### Prepare for potential questions

**Identify your skills**

- You can think of skills in 2 primary categories - technical and non technical
  - For technical skills: What are the most commonly used languages, frameworks, databases etc you have been using on a regular basis for the past few years?
  - For non-technical skills: You can use this list of skills as a starting point. 
- Outside of technical skills, SPs typically look for the following skills:
  - Communication (verbal and written)
  - Teamwork
  - Problem solving
  - Attention to detail
  - Leadership (delegation, and mentorship) 
  - Adaptability 

**Reframe your knowledge and experience gaps**

There are skills that the SP is looking for that you lack experience. How should I reframe my gaps? 

- Always make sure to talk about your gaps (weaknesses) in a positive light. Discuss what you are doing to improve those gaps and what resources you can leverage within the Commit community to bridge those areas. 
- Example: Let’s say the role you are interviewing for is a full-stack engineer. Your experience is mainly in the frontend, and you lack some backend or DevOps experience. Highlight how you will be leveraging Zero. *Note: use your commit.dev email to access this link.

**Ensure you’re equipped to provide a comprehensive answer**

One helpful way to frame these questions is by using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

**Sample question: Tell me about a time when you worked with a difficult team member.**

- **Situation** - 2 years ago, I was acting as a lead on a project where the product manager wanted full visibility of the product, more than any previous product managers I’d worked with. This was a new product manager, who was still learning our team structure and our product.  
- **Task** - The challenge was managing their high expectations, but also managing the fact we were understaffed. There were fewer developers than stages of the project, which meant it was difficult to demonstrate results, frustrating this product manager. 
- **Action** - I took the time to more critically examine the project. I determined that even though all 10 stages were needed for the MVP, we could get better progress if we made an intermediate milestone of just stage 3, 6, and 8. This would also help demonstrate the viability of the design overall.
- **Result** - After about 2 one-on-one discussions with the PM, they agreed to let us try it this way, and gave us some breathing room. We brought up 3, 6, and 8, and this showed we didn't need most of the other stages after all for an MVP.
 
**A list of common interview questions for you to practice answering the STAR method:**

- What is your greatest weakness?
  - Another way to reframe this question: Tell me about a time when things didn’t go as planned, and tell me how you are improving. 
- Tell me about a project that didn’t go according to plan.
- How do you handle disagreements with your team lead?
  - Bonus question: How do you handle disagreements with other teams/product stakeholders?
- What is something new that you’ve learned recently?
- Tell me about how you manage deadlines. 
- How do you handle a team member who is not acting as an equal contributor?

## During the interview

- Arrive at your Zoom interview on time but not too early. We recommend entering your Zoom interview 2-3 mins before your scheduled interview. 
  - What happens if the interviewer doesn’t show up? 
    - If it’s been 5-10mins past the interview time and no one from the SP team has showed up, please email the SP about this matter  
- Go in with a positive attitude, warmth, and smile! This may seem obvious, but in a virtual interview, body language can be harder to read.  
  - SPs are not only looking for someone who can code, but a core team member who can also lead, build team culture and are excited with what they are working on. 

- Elaborate! - Don’t just give one-word answers. People want to see that you can think in detail. 
- Thank the interviewer for their time at the end of the interview.  

- Ask questions! 
  - Interviews are a 2-way conversation - you should equally be interviewing them to make sure they fit your professional goals and aspirations. 
- Remember - you’ve been selected for a reason! 
  - We’re confident you are exceptional and a gift to a startup. 
- Imagine that you are sitting beside the startup founder having coffee - this isn’t you under a microscope.

## After the interview

- Send your interviewers a [thank you email](https://www.algrim.co/264-thank-you-email-after-interview)
  - This doesn’t have to be long: 5-8 sentences should suffice.
  - The goal is to reiterate why you’d be a good fit, and also share about why you’re excited about the opportunity
- Make some notes - what questions really threw you off? What questions do you feel you answered exceptionally well?
  - Reflecting on an interview is a key part of improvement. Interviewing is a skill and takes practice to really hone your craft. 
- After reflecting on what went well and what didn’t go as expected, feel free to share these in your EPX channel - we are here to help support you and help you ace your interviews! 

If you have any questions about anything related to SP interviews, drop them in your EPX channel or ask for a one-on-one coaching session with [Louisa](https://calendly.com/louisasmith)!
