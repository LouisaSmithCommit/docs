## HOP Demo 

What are the limits on your Hackathon Onboarding Project (HOP)?

- When choosing your HOP, it’s important to select a project that interests you, challenges your abilities, and get clear on the scope. You’ll present your 7-minute long HOP demo at the community-wide All Hands meeting two weeks after your start date where you’ll talk about what you learned, what you would do differently, and what stretch goals you have.

What if you don't finish in time or your demo is bad?

- No demos are bad! Oftentimes our Engineer Partners (EP’s) will be more motivated to continue to work on their HOP demo even after their presentation. This is common because they will be curious to approach the problem from a different way, using another tool or language and achieve another solution. A finished product is never the be-all-end-all goal of the HOP demo. As long as you can explain your thought process, the why and the problem you’re trying to solve, your peers will be excited to learn from you! 
 
## Matchmaking 

When should I expect matches & interviews?

- Matches are generally sent to your epx-[name] Slack channel within your first week at Commit and you could expect interviews to also be scheduled in your first week.

How long do I have to decide if I want to pursue a match?

- Ideally, you’d make a decision on pursuing a match or not within 24 hours. Should you need any support in deciding on moving forward with a match, Engineer Success is just a Slack message or call away!

Do you tell us why we are rejected, or other feedback? Is the feedback filtered?

- Should an SP decide not to move forward with you as a candidate, we’d follow up with them for feedback and in some cases, they’d reach out to you directly. We try to be as transparent as possible with the feedback we send to you so we help identify ways to increase a better match for you in the future and in some cases offer you some interviewing resources.

Should I tailor my Commit profile for each company, or have different versions that emphasize different things for different roles? 

- There won’t be a need to have multiple profiles for each company/opportunity. The beauty of your profile is that it’s organized in a way that clearly showcases your technical abilities, interests, and goals so an SP can better see if there is possible alignment. SP’s also follow a similar format for creating their own profile which makes finding a match more efficient. 

After an interview, when should I expect more information? Is waiting bad? 

- Following an interview, you should expect an answer regarding next steps within 72 hours. Waiting isn’t necessarily bad! In many cases, SP teams are just super busy and sometimes require a reminder from Engineer Success. 

How are matches made? 

- Engineer Success does their best to select matches for you and a SP where there is alignment on some or all the following criteria: title, tech stack, values, industry, company size, and salary. Should an available EP’s goals, interests, and experience align with that of an SP’s, we’d then send along a match. There may be cases where an EP’s goals, interests, and experience may not align with what an SP is looking for and vice versa in which case we may refrain from making a match.

How will I know when I have a match? 

- Should there be a match between you and the SP, you’d be notified in your epx-[name] Slack channel. It’s then up to you to review the SPs profile to decide if you’d like to proceed in setting up an interview. Should you be unsure about how you’d like to proceed, remember you can always connect with Engineer Success. Matches are being made each week so can expect a few matches at once or matches to be spread over multiple days. 

How much prep should I be doing for interviews? What kind of prep? 

- We highly recommended reviewing the Interview Guide for EPs prior to an interview. This article includes tips and tricks for what to expect in an interview, how to prepare, how to seamlessly tackle the STAR method, etc! Should you still need additional resources after reviewing this document, please reach out to Engineer Success at least 1 business day ahead of your interview so they can best support you. 

What kind of additional discussions do you have with SPs about specific candidates?

- It’s up to the SP to decide if an EP aligns and fits with their team. Engineer Success does its best to find a pilot for each EP that will lead to graduation and a long term fit understanding the career goals of the person and direction of the company. SP’s will often share their growth plans with their engineering team which helps with our matching! 

How does Engineer Success decide on matches?

- An SP looks through your Helix profile to see if your experience, goals, and interests have alignment with their own. If they feel there is good alignment and they’d like to chat more, they’ll accept the match and you’ll be notified in your epx-[name] Slack channel. It’s important that you completely and fully fill out your Helix profile so that SPs have enough information to make a decision on a match. The article: Creating and Editing Your Commit Platform Profile is a great resource for knowing where to start. As usual, the Engineer Success Team is here to help if you have any questions.

Are SPs shown all available engineers at once? 

- EPs who join Commit have different backgrounds and specializations. Should an available EP’s goals, interests, and experience align with that of an SP’s, we’d then send along a match. There may be cases where an EP’s goals, interests, and experience may not align with what an SP is looking for and vice versa in which case we may refrain from making a match. 

Who schedules interviews and follow up interviews? Is there a recommended process? 

- Another great resource is the Matchmaking Process which outlines all of these steps. To highlight a few, should you be notified in your epx-[name] Slack channel about an SP requesting an interview, you’d have the option in Slack to accept the match, which would trigger an email to the SP letting them know you’re interested. From there, you’d respond directly to that email with your Calendly link so the SP can book a time. For more information on how to set up Calendly, check out this article on Calendly Guidelines. Should the SP be interested in a second interview, they would either let you or Engineer Success know via email. Should you want to proceed to interview 2, you’d send a thank you note and send along your Calendly link. 

How do I know if I need to adjust my profile/resume/LinkedIn? 

- Engineer Success will be sure to look through your Commit profile prior to making you matches with SPs. Should we have any feedback and suggestions for your profile, we’d let you know. Your profile includes all of what you’d showcase on your resume, so there is no need during this process to use both your profile and your resume. Should you want to review and/or spruce up your LinkedIn profile, let Engineer Success know and we can set up some dedicated time to connect. We always suggest adding a new role to your LinkedIn profile indicating that you’re a Commit Engineering Partner.

Is it ok to say yes to match if I want to hear more, even though I suspect it won't fit? 

- Yes! Proceeding with the match and interview doesn’t hurt. You may be surprised that the match is a better fit than you thought and if not, you just got some interview practice and learned about what you’re not interested in.

Is there an average or percentage of how many interviews an EP is expected to accept? Ex/ If there are 5 offers, is it okay to say No to 2 with reasoning?

- Although we currently don't have the average or percentage of how often an EP accepts an interview, if there are interview opportunities that come up where you're really not interested in the company or don't feel the role would suit you, it's okay to reject it, but we'd just like to know why you're rejecting it. That will help us make better matches for you in the future.
- We do hope that there is a good chance that out of the 5 opportunities, that you'll likely be interested in at least a few.
- Let's say it was the case that you didn't feel the majority of opportunities are a fit and Engineer Success is having trouble finding a match. We'd then reach out to chat more about your goals and interests so we can work to support you in this process and make sure the program can still support your needs. You can read more about this in the EP Expectations articles.
- A key thing that can help the matching process from your end is having an open mind, so even if an opportunity arises that you don't think is a perfect match, it could still be worth interviewing with the company to get a better sense if it indeed isn't a great fit or is a better fit than you thought.
 
## SPs 

Are SPs also hiring from outside Commit? 

- SPs might also be hiring outside of Commit in order to have a range of candidates to fill their positions. Commit does have an excellent reputation with our SPs and have seen many successful EP candidates join 3-month pilots and graduate to an SP full-time. 
 
## General 

How do I know if I'm meeting Commit's expectations?

- Commit’s expectations from HOP demos is that engineers are approaching the assignment as a learning opportunity to tackle a project or interest that you may have not had the bandwidth to do so before. It is never about perfection but rather the process and sharing the why and lessons learned with the rest of the community. Communication, contributions, and participation are all expectations of you throughout your journey with Commit. To understand more fully what’s expected of you as an EP, take a look at our EP Expectations articles.
 
## Pilots & Graduation

How often do pilots lead to graduation? 

- The average number of pilots that an EP completes before graduation is 1.7. That means you can usually expect it to take 1-2 pilots before graduating to an SP full-time. Keep in mind that this is just an average and everyone is different. Engineer Success’ goal is to work closely with you throughout the whole process to help find you the best possible fit.

Is there a limit to the number of pilots? 

- There isn’t a limit to the number of pilots an EP can do. As mentioned above, Engineer Success aims to create a long-lasting match as soon as possible, but we know that in some cases it can take some time to find the perfect match.
 
## Nomination

When can we nominate people?

- Anytime! We are always looking to expand our community of like-minded entrepreneurial startup software engineers! To nominate a peer, message your epx-[name] Slack channel with your peer's name and email.

What kind of people should we nominate? How do we know if a colleague is right for Commit?

- Entrepreneurial
- Interested in startups
- Self-starter
- We are looking for engineers just like yourselves!
