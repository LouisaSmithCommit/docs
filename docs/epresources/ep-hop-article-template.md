## Goal

Write an article that summarizes your experience with your HOP:

- What your project is and what it does
- How it works and how you built it
- What you learned

Suggested max article length: 500 words

Include a few images of your final HOP, or code snippets, to break up the text. More is better!

## Timeline

- **Friday of Week 1** - You’ll create a rough skeleton blog article using tips in [Rough structure and writing prompts](#rough-structure-and-writing-prompts). Take this time to fill in some blanks as you’ve now selected your demo idea. 
- **Monday of Week 2** - Begin answering prompting questions in [Rough structure and writing prompts](#rough-structure-and-writing-prompts) and start incorporating them into your blog. It can help to draft a few bullet point ideas to start.
- **Tuesday and Wednesday of Week 2** - Turn your focus to fleshing out bullet points and on building a more robust version of your article. Aim to have a draft ready for Thursday morning. 
- **Thursday of Week 2** - Your draft is ready and you’ll be attending a session called “*Commit Onboarding: Working out loud*” where you’ll meet with Commit’s copywriting team. This is an excellent opportunity to get feedback and ask questions! Following this session, you’ll make revisions to your blog and will have a final version ready for tomorrow EOD. 
- **Friday of Week 2** - You’ll have a final version of your blog post ready by EOD today and will submit it to our copywriting team for review.
- **Week 3** - You'll expect final revisions from the copywriting team on your article. You’re now ready to showcase all your hard work by making a LinkedIn post about your blog! This article is an excellent accomplishment to include in your record of work and is a great talking point in interviews.
- **Add your blog to your Record of Work (RoW)** - You should be proud of your HOP demo (we are!) and suggest you sharing this blog published blog post on your online profiles (LinkedIn, Github etc)! 
 
## Example

[Fabio Miranda’s HOP article](https://commit.dev/2022/01/11/docker-is-in-the-details-my-hackathon-onboarding-project/)

## Intro statement

We start each HOP article with the following intro, so you don’t need to explain the concept of the HOP, you can just dive into your story and your HOP project. It’s good to have a line that says something like, “For my hackathon onboarding project, I made an app that tracks my marathon-training progress.” Or whatever you’re working on!

> In their first week with Commit, each new Engineering Partner takes on a hackathon onboarding project. They build a project, present it to the Commit community, and write a short summary of their experience. There are no restrictions, no limits, no joke.

## Rough structure and writing prompts

You don’t need to address all of these questions. They’re just thought-starters.

### What your project is and what it does

- How did you choose your project? What was your thought process? 
- Was there a particular tech stack you wanted to learn?
- Does the project connect to a personal interest (finance, sports, literature, etc.)
- What did you build?
- What does it do?

### How does it work and how did you build it?

- How did you go about building it?
- Are there 2 or 3 interesting components you can describe? 
- Did you run into any roadblocks? How did you get through them?
- Add a couple snippets of code if possible

### What you learned

- What are some other features you could add? Or other ways to improve the project?
 
## Last 5 things

1. **Write a one- or two-sentence bio for yourself.** Example:
> For over a decade, Thomas Choo has been a Software Engineer focused on re-architecting and migrating large backend systems across a number of industry verticals, from telco to social media platforms. When he isn't at a computer, he’s probably exploring breathtaking hikes.

2. **What’s your title?** Make it short, snappy and interesting. Example: *Polishing the platform: My hackathon onboarding project*

3. **Write a compelling Linkedin post** to encourage people to read your post. Not just "I wrote a blog post for Commit,” but a personal anecdote about the experience or a few lines about what you learned. You can even pull from the article if you like. (Our Content team can help)

4. **What photo should you use for your blog header?** We’ll use your photo from your Humi onboarding checklist unless you provide another one. Keep in mind that it should be in landscape format, not portrait. Make it representative of yourself and your interests, not just a headshot

5. **Write a tweet to share your article** (Our Content team can help).
