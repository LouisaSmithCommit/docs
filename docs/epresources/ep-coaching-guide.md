Commit offers coaching to Support Team members and EPs through the Sphere Coaching App!

## Why coaching?

We feel that professional development goes beyond formal training and on-the-job learning. We believe working with coaches on Sphere will allow you to gain clarity on how you want to develop professionally while also taking care of your mental health. You can work with any Guide on any part of your life; you get to decide!

## Will I find a coach that suits my needs?

Everyone at Commit gets access to coaching. But what's unique about working with Sphere is that you get to choose from over 400 coaches to find the one match for your needs. 

## What are the benefits of Sphere coaching?

Since introducing Sphere as a benefit, we've seen that those who commit at least 1 hr/month to work with a coach have significantly grown in their roles. Remember, a coach can help with leadership skills, confidence, effective goal-setting, purpose, communication. Conversations with your coaches are also safe and confidential spaces for you to discuss challenges at work.

## How many hours of coaching is available to me monthly?

Sphere credits are shared across the entire organization. Since sharing is caring, we ask that you use a maximum of 12 credits per month. That translates to 2 hours of coaching sessions which you can divide across the month as suits your schedule.
Many folks will opt for a single 30 minute session each week, or two 1 hour sessions each month.   

At Commit, we believe in growth at all levels of leadership. We're excited for you to tap into this incredible resource!

If you have any questions afterwards, please let the Engineer Success team know.
