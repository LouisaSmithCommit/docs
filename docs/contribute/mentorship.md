No matter where you might be in your professional career, mentorship can help you reframe problems, better understand a career move, and meet other like minded folks. Mentorship may have been a part of your career already - sharing knowledge with junior team members, code reviews, etc.

We invite all of our community members and EPs to sign up to [Together](https://www.togetherplatform.com/), our mentorship platform. By using this platform, we are creating a curated, trusted community of mentors to learn from, and mentees who are curious and passionate about career growth and problem solving.

**Why bother with the effort of more formal mentorship**

- Find someone best suited to answer a specific problem (or maybe you're the one answering it!)
- Have a structured relationship to help you grow in a more direct and tailored way.
- Connect with a trusted network of engineers to grow and learn from, and perhaps even work with in the future. 
 
## The Platform

Our platform, Together is mentee led, meaning if you're a mentee, you can select a mentor who you are confident will be a great fit to help reach your career goals and get your questions answered. If you're a mentor, you can review requests from mentees. 

Don't think you're the best person to support them at this time? Not a problem - you can let them know. Time commitment an issue? You get to select how many mentees you can take on at a time, so your plate is never too full.

### How does it work?

1. You are able to sign up as a mentor, mentee, or both!
2. Fill out your profile (takes about 10 minutes)
3. Mentees select their top mentor(s) they think could be a great fit for them
4. Mentors review the request and choose to move forward with mentee(s)
5. If you're matched, you can exchange contact information through the platform and meet using the video conferencing platform of your choice.
6. Together gives you prompts on how to structure your first 6 sessions, but feel free to make this your own to get maximum benefit!
7. Reached the end of your time together? You can find a new mentor/mentee to connect with and start the learning all over again.
