## Introduction to Slack at Commit

Welcome to the home of all things Slack channel related! Here you will find the how, what and why to use Commit’s Slack channels successfully. Slack is driven by the community and their contribution to communicate better and to the right people. 

When joining the community, you will by default be added to these channels:

| Slack Channel Name | Topic | Description  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| #community-intros | A channel for all new members to introduce themselves to the community!    | Tell us where you’re from, what you’re masterful at, what you want to learn and why you’re most excited about joining the Commit Community! |
| #commit-news | Company-wide announcements from the Support Team. See: https://docs.commit.dev/ for internal Commit resources | This channel is for company updates, communications and announcements. All community members are included in this channel. Only Support Team (ST) members can post. |
| #commit-mentors | A channel for mentorship conversations, resources,and  connections! | A channel to connect and communicate with mentors in our mentorship program. You can expect mentorship updates and news in this channel. Feel free to share any resources related to mentorship! |
| #community-suggestions | A channel to suggest ideas for new community events, workshops and other learning and development initiatives. | All community members are encouraged to contribute and continuously collaborate to improve to grow our community impact. |
| #diversity-and-inclusion | A psychologically safe place to share resources and questions about all things DEI. | A channel to learn and unlearn together as a community. |
| #events | Learning and development initiatives, meetups and other events. | A channel to promote, discuss and share updates regarding past and upcoming events. |
| #resources | A channel to share resources to support learning, development, newsworth announcements and more! | We want to promote a community of learning together and faster to spark connections of other developers learning the same things. |
| #random | Non-work banter and water cooler conversation. | A place for non-work-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber you'd prefer to keep out of more focused work-related channels. |
| #community-help | All things community support. | Non-technical support from the Commit Community Management team, for technical support on the platform, use #platform-help |
| #platform-help | All things platform support. | Questions, bugs or feedback on your platform experience! For non-technical questions, use #community-help. |
| #shoutouts | A way to recognize your peers in the community. | A great place to shout out specific community members and help them know how much they are appreciated! |
| #wins | A place to call out wins in your day and share learnings with the community. | Where we celebrate wins of all shapes & sizes. |

These channels will get you on your way to understand our community discussions more. However, you are not restricted to just these channels! We encourage our community to create sub channels to dive deeper into specific topics, languages and learnings.

## How to use the Slack Commit Community (along with some tips & tricks)

-   Public Channels (by default): As referenced in our Code of Conduct, we aim to promote Working Out Loud whenever possible. This promotes psychological safety in the community and will allow for more individuals to participate (and learn) from the conversations.
    
-   Find Channels: Beside channels, click the + sign and select ‘Browse Channels’, from here, you will be able to search key works and join channels relevant to you.
    
-   Direct Messages: We recognize that there are times when conversations can lead to 1:1 connections or small groups. Our Slack offers the option of directly messaging other members of the community.
    
-   Mute Channels: Want to stay in the channel but not get all the notifications? Slack allows you to mute specific channels to keep noise levels down; this can be done following these steps: Open the channel you'd like to mute > Click the channel name in the conversation header > Below the channel name, click the notifications menu >Select Mute channel.
    
-   Turn off notifications from a thread: On the comment, select the 3 dots on the right that lead to ‘More Actions’, then select the first option in the drop down ‘turn off notifications for replies’.
 

## How to search for Slack channels and create your own

To create your own channel; follow our guidelines below:

-   Create Channel in Slack from the drop down
    
-   Name channel to be specific to the topic of discussion [Ex. #Role/Team-Coding Language/Project Name]

Our Slack community is monitored by our Engineer Success team. We are one Slack message (#community-help) or email (success@commit.dev) away to assist you. Have an idea on how to improve our community? Let us know in #community-suggestions!
