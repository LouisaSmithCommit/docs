Invitations are the life-blood of Commit. They ensure that we can continue to grow our community while keeping the talent-level opportunities at the best of the best startups.

As an EP at Commit, we want to find opportunities that excite you!

If there is a startup on your radar, or an organization doing something that excites you, share it with us. By inviting a Startup Partner to join our program, we not only get to meet awesome Startups but we also get to understand what types of organizations you would like to see from Commit in the future.

## How do I know if a Startup Partner will be a fit?
When inviting a startup, keep in mind a few things:

1. They MUST be remote or hybrid.

2. They MUST be based in North America.

3. They MUST excite you!
