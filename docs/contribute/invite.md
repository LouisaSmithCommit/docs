Invitations are the life-blood of Commit. They ensure that we can continue to grow our community while keeping the talent-level high.

We want to make it easier and lightweight for EPs to invite/recommend/share Commit with another software engineer in a natural way.

If being part of the Commit community and EP program has benefited you, think about who else in your network it could help. 

Whenever you are ready to invite someone you can take any of the following steps:
- Send a message to a member of the Engineering Success Team on your EPX Slack channel
- Email us at success@commit.dev

We will then jump in to figure out how we can best support them. Even if they are not looking for a new job today, we are starting to roll out more products and programs that can help them catalyze a startup engineering career.

Thank you for your support!
