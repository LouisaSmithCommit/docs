We are always looking for individuals to contribute to [the blog](https://commit.dev/blog/) and we love technical content!

We wholeheartedly believe that having people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives write copy provides for richer and more meaningful content.

Currently we are a small and nimble team of tech enthusiasts creating the content. The best way to contribute right away is to email us at [content@commit.dev](mailto:content@commit.dev) with your idea and a short outline we will get back to you within 48 hours about next steps! If you have already written some content in the past, we are also happy to republish it.

We also have a running list of [content ideas](https://airtable.com/appsQbyWJGteh5FTw/tblYX9TOfo6QbPnwv/viwY12SQHBY8UFDVl?blocks=hide) if you are stuck! Feel free to choose any of them you are passionate about and let us know via email marketing@commit.dev that you are interested in writing about it.

Last but not least, the content published on our page will be credited back to you of course and we will share it on all our social media accounts and would love for you to share it as well once it is live!
