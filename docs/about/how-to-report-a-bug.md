At Commit we are always encouraging of engineers to report any bugs or issues that they find. We recognize the value of having a community of engineers that are able to report these bugs to help better both our product and the work our team is doing. 

These bugs are celebrated in our #dev channel to encourage others to do the same! 

## How to report an issue or bug on the Commit platform

There are two ways to do so:

1. Report the issue in the Slack channel #platform-helix, link can be found here.

2. Email our platform team at platform@commit.dev

The goal of reaching out is to inform our platform team to be able to take immediate action and resolve the issue as timely possible!
