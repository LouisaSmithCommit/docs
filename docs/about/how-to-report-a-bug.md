At Commit we encourage engineers to report any bugs or issues that they find with our Platform, these Commit Docs, or really anything else. We recognize the value of having a community of engineers that are able to report these bugs to help better both our product and the work our team is doing. 

## How to report an issue or bug on the Commit platform

These bugs are celebrated in our [#dev](https://commitdev.slack.com/archives/CG1FYLKFD) channel to encourage others to do the same! There are two ways to do so:

1. Report the issue in the Slack channel [#platform-help](https://commitdev.slack.com/archives/CL62LV6JH)

2. Email our platform team at [platform@commit.dev](mailto:platform@commit.dev)

The goal of reaching out is to inform our platform team to be able to take immediate action and resolve the issue as quickly as possible!
